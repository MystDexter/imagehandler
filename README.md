# imagehandler

For the purpose of this assessment I opted to explore the MEAN stack (MySql, Express.JS, Angular, Node). I have zero experience developing with these Angular and Express prior to this, but I took this as a challenge to try my hands on something new and unfamiliar regardless of the outcome. The MEAN stack is one of those things i wanted to dabble into but never really had the chance to, so I'm glad I got to play with it for this assessment.
What I have built is quite barebones and doesn't exactly fulfil all enhancements as outlined, but in the interest of time and not wanting to exceed the minimum time recommended, I've decided to submit what I have so far. It's not much, but I'm happy with what I've learned from it.

## What you will need

Express will be the server on which the app will run on Port 3000

### To run express server:
From the project root
- Run npm install

- Open src/main.js. file. If you're on Visual Studio Code, run and debug in node.js environment.

- Enter localhost:3000 on browser. Output should be "OK" if all is well

Angular will be the web client

### To run the web client
- in terminal run cd imagehandler-angular-client

- npm install

- npm start

- After compile, go to http://localhost:4200 on your browser
